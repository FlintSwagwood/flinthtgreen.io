                <p>Solar Photovoltaic systems have come of age. Installers now can guarantee reliable cost-free power to your
                    home or business. ROI is now taking less time than ever thanks to the ever decreasing equipment costs and
                    better technology. If you have battery storage such as a Tesla Powerwall or similar Lithium Ion chemistry
                    solutions then you can take your savings even further. Call us now to discuss which solution is the best fit for
                    your home.</p>

                <img src="images/geo250.jpg" alt="Geothermal Energy">
                <p>Energy from the earth. It sounds simple because it is. The earth is warmer than the air and we can use this to
                    heat your home. HT Green can engineer a solution to fit your situation to give you free plentiful home warming
                    energy year-round. Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, and environmentally friendly, but has
                    previously been geographically limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries.</p>
                <p>Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially
                    for direct applications such as home heating. Geothermal wells tend to release greenhouse gases trapped
                    deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower than those of conventional fossil fuels. As a result,
                    geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming if widely deployed instead of fossil fuels.</p>
